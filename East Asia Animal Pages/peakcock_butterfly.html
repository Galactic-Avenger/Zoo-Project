            The chinese peacock butterfly or known by its scientific name Papilio bianor is a stunning species of swallowtail buttefly found
            across East Asia, including China, Japan, and Taiwan. One of its most prominent features are its iridescent green and blue wings that shine
            in the sunlight. They kind of resemble the dazzling colors of a peacock's feather hence the name the Chinese Peacock Butterfly. But this butterfly's
            colors aren't just for show as they are also for camoflauge and acts as a defense mechanism against predators. These butterflies are usually found in forests,
            gardens, and mountains feeding on nectars from flowers. Growing up as a caterpillar they primary source of food was citrus plants until they bloomed into a beautiful 
            butterfly. Despite their weak looking appearance they are actually strong fliers. Like many animals they start to face challenges like the destruction of habitat 
            due to industrialization and climate change.
