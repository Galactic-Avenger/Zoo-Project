            The red pandas or by their scientific name Ailurus fulgens is a lesser panda species and is native to the 
            Himalayas and the southerwestern China. They are known for their reddish-brown fur, bushy tail, and interesting looking face.
            Despite their name they aren't that closely related to the bigger panda that we often know of but rather they are more closely
            related to raccons and weasels. Red pandas are primarily herbivorous meaning they eat bamboos, fruits, berries, and sometimes very small insects.
            Over the recent years because of habitat loss from industrialization, poaching, and climate change red pandas are starting to become endangered.
            Since 2008 they were listed as a endangered animal by IUCN(International Union for Conservation of Nature).
