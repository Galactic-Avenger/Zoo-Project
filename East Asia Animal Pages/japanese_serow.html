            The japanese serow or by their scientific name Capricornis crispus is a unique type of goat species that is native to the forests and mountains
            of Japan. One of their most prominent attributes is their thick fur which can range in colors and their shorts horns which help them survive in the rough
            conditions of the Japanese forests and mountains. Because of the conditions they live in they have strong legs that let them navigate these terrains. These species of
            goats are primarily herbivories meaning they eat things like leaves and grass. These animals were once heavily hunted in Japan and as a result of this they are now being 
            protected as a National Treasure of Japan. They are also considered the symbol of Japan like the symbol of nation's wild heritage.
