            The komodo dragon or by theirs scientific name Varanus komodoensis is a animal that is native to the five islands in
            Southeastern Indonesia(Komodo, Rinca, Gili Montang, Gili Dasami, and Flores). Komodo dragons are the world's largest living lizard.
            They can grow up to 10 feet long and weigh over 150 pounds. They are primary a carnivore meaning they eat other animals. They do so by
            using their long claws and sharp teeth to hunt down these animals. The reason why Komodo dragons are called dragons despite being a giant lizard 
            is because their appearance resembling a dragon hence the name komodo dragon. One fun fact about Komodo dragons are that they actually venomous. Their saliva 
            is venomous and can be used to help hunt down their prey. Komodo dragons as of today are placed on the endangered list in 2021 by the 
            IUCN(International Union for Conservation of Nature). The reason for this is because of human interference and habitat loss.
