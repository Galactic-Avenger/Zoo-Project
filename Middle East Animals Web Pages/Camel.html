            <p>
                The <strong>Dromedary Camel</strong>, also known as the <i>Arabian Camel</i>, is a <b>one-humped species</b> 
                adapted to **desert life**. It is famous for its ability to **survive without water for long periods**, thanks to its **efficient water storage system**.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike popular belief, the camel's hump does not store water but **fat reserves**, which can be converted into energy and hydration. 
                Their long legs and padded feet allow them to walk effortlessly on **hot desert sand**, and their thick eyelashes and closable nostrils 
                protect them from sandstorms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Camels have been an **essential part of Arabian culture for centuries**, used for **transportation, milk production, and trade**. 
                Today, they remain **highly valued in desert regions** and are often seen in camel races and traditional festivities.
