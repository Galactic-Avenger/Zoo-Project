            The Egyptian Vulture (<i>Neophron percnopterus</i>) is a unique scavenger bird known for its intelligence. 
            Unlike other vultures, it uses tools like rocks to crack open eggs, making it one of the few birds to 
            exhibit tool usage.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has a striking appearance with white feathers and a yellow face. Despite its adaptability, the species 
            faces threats due to habitat loss, poisoning, and electrocution from power lines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conservation efforts focus on creating awareness about the importance of vultures in ecosystems. 
            They play a crucial role in cleaning up dead animals and preventing the spread of disease.
