            The Palestine Sunbird (<i>Cinnyris osea</i>) is a small, vibrant bird native to the Middle East. 
            Males boast iridescent plumage that shimmers in shades of green and blue, while females have more subdued gray tones.

            These sunbirds primarily feed on nectar, using their curved bills to access flowers. 
            They also consume insects, especially during the breeding season, to provide protein for their chicks.

            Often seen flitting among gardens and wildflowers, the Palestine Sunbird plays a vital role in pollination.
