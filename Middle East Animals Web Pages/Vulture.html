                The <strong>Egyptian Vulture</strong> is a unique bird of prey, often referred to as the Pharaohâ€™s Chicken due to 
                its importance in ancient Egyptian mythology. It is recognizable by its <i>white feathers, yellow face, and sharp beak</i>.

                Unlike most vultures, the Egyptian Vulture is known for its high intelligence. It is one of the few bird species 
                that uses tools, often dropping stones to break eggshells to access food. This ability showcases its problem-solving skills.

                Unfortunately, the population of this species has declined due to habitat destruction, poisoning, and illegal hunting. 
                Conservation efforts are in place to protect this important scavenger, which plays a crucial role in keeping ecosystems clean.
