            The Arabian Wolf (<i>Canis lupus arabs</i>) is a small and highly adaptable subspecies of the gray wolf 
            found in the Middle East. Unlike larger wolves, it is known for hunting alone or in pairs rather than in packs.
        </p>
        <p>
            It feeds on rodents, hares, and sometimes livestock, making it a common target for farmers. 
            Due to habitat destruction and hunting, its population has declined significantly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conservation efforts are focused on protecting Arabian Wolves through wildlife reserves 
            and educational programs to reduce human-wildlife conflicts.
