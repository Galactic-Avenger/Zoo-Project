                The <strong>Arabian Wolf</strong> (<i>Canis lupus arabs</i>) is a small but highly resilient subspecies of the gray wolf. 
                It is native to the deserts and rocky terrains of the Arabian Peninsula, including parts of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, 
                and Jordan. Unlike larger wolves, the Arabian Wolf has adapted to extreme heat and scarce water sources, making it one 
                of the most resourceful predators in the region.

                Physically, the Arabian Wolf is smaller and leaner than its northern relatives, with shorter fur to cope with the heat. 
                It has large ears to help release excess body heat, and its coat is a blend of tan, gray, and white, allowing it to 
                blend seamlessly with desert landscapes. Unlike larger wolf packs, Arabian Wolves live in small groups or alone, relying 
                on their stealth and intelligence to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to habitat destruction, hunting, and conflicts with farmers, the Arabian Wolf population has declined significantly 
                over the years. Farmers often view them as a threat to livestock, leading to widespread hunting. However, conservation 
                programs in Oman and Saudi Arabia are working to protect and preserve this unique predator before it disappears from 
                the wild.
