            <p>
                The Arabian Oryx (<i>Oryx leucoryx</i>) is a desert-dwelling antelope with a striking white coat and long, straight horns. 
                It is well adapted to the harsh, arid environments of the Middle East, where it can survive without water for long periods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once extinct in the wild due to excessive hunting, conservation efforts have successfully reintroduced the species 
                to protected areas in Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. These efforts have transformed the Arabian Oryx into 
                a conservation success story.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Arabian Oryx primarily feeds on grasses, roots, and desert plants. It has an incredible ability to detect rainfall 
                from miles away and will migrate accordingly to find fresh vegetation.
