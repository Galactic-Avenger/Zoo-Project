            The Arabian Oryx (<i>Oryx leucoryx</i>) is a medium-sized antelope native to the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula. 
            Known for its striking white coat, it helps the oryx reflect sunlight and stay cool in the harsh desert environment. 
            This species is well-adapted to desert life, capable of surviving without water for extended periods.

            The Arabian Oryx was once declared extinct in the wild due to excessive hunting. 
            However, conservation programs have successfully reintroduced them to protected reserves in Saudi Arabia, 
            the United Arab Emirates, and Oman. Thanks to these efforts, the species has made a remarkable comeback.

            These herbivores primarily feed on grasses, roots, and desert plants. They are known for their exceptional 
            ability to detect rainfall from miles away, allowing them to migrate in search of food and water. 
            Today, the Arabian Oryx is a symbol of wildlife conservation success in the Middle East.
