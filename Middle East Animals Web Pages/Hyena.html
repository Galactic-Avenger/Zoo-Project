            <p>
                The <strong>Striped Hyena</strong> (<i>Hyaena hyaena</i>) is a mysterious and elusive scavenger found in the Middle East, 
                North Africa, and parts of India. Unlike the more aggressive spotted hyena, the striped hyena is solitary and nocturnal, 
                preferring to avoid human interaction. It plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by cleaning up animal carcasses.

                Physically, the striped hyena has distinctive black stripes on its grayish fur, a short mane along its back, and large ears 
                for detecting prey and avoiding danger. When threatened, it can raise the hairs on its back to appear much larger, a natural defense 
                mechanism against predators like leopards and wolves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite its importance in maintaining ecosystem balance, the striped hyena is often misunderstood and hunted due to folklore 
                and fear. Habitat destruction and poaching have led to a decline in population, but conservation efforts aim to protect this 
                unique species and raise awareness of its ecological significance.
