            The Striped Hyena (<i>Hyaena hyaena</i>) is a nocturnal scavenger found across the Middle East. 
            Characterized by its striped coat, erect mane, and powerful jaws, it plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by consuming carrion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although primarily scavengers, striped hyenas are opportunistic feeders and may hunt small animals or consume fruits and insects when available. 
            They are solitary or live in small family groups, often covering vast distances in search of food.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite their ecological importance, striped hyenas face threats from habitat loss, persecution, and declining prey availability. 
            Conservation initiatives aim to protect their habitats and promote coexistence with human communities.
