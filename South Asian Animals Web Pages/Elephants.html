                    Elephants are known for their large ears, tusks made of ivory, and their trunks,  which are actually a fusion of their nose and upper lip. 
                    Elephants are herbivores and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. 
                    Elephants use their trunks to pick up objects, suck up water, and also to greet other elephants. 
                    Elephants are intelligent, and have exceptional memory; their lifespan is up to 70 years. 
                    Elephants are social animals and live in groups called herds. 
                    Elephants are known for their close-knit family groups and strong social bonds.
                    They are also playful animals and have been observed playing with objects and engaging in activities like swimming and mud bathing.
                    Elephants are also known for their empathy and altruism. 
                    Elephants are considered to be a keystone species because they play a crucial role in maintaining the biodiversity of the ecosystems they inhabit. 
                    Elephants are also considered to be a flagship species because they are a symbol of conservation and are used to raise awareness about the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats. 
                    Elephants are threatened by habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. 
                    Conservation efforts are being made to protect elephants and their habitats.
